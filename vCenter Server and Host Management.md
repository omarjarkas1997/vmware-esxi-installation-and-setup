- ### **vSphere Concepts and Features**
    - **What does a VMware vSphere data center consists of?**
        - A typical VMware vSphere data center consists of physical building blocks such as **`x86 virtualization servers`**,** `storage networks and arrays`**, **`IP networks`**, **`a management server`**, **`Single Sign-On`**, and **`desktop clients`**
            - **What are the `ESXi Hosts - x86 virtualization servers`**?
                - ESXi hosts are industry-standard x86 servers running VMware's ESXi hypervisor directly on the hardware (bare-metal). ESXi manages and provides resources (CPU, memory, storage, networking) for running virtual machines. Multiple similarly-configured ESXi hosts, connected to the same network and storage subsystems, can be grouped into a cluster. This creates a pooled set of resources in the virtual environment, enhancing high availability, fault tolerance, and load balancing. In essence, **ESXi hosts are the foundation of a vSphere environment**, providing the raw resources that are virtualized and allocated to the running VMs.
            - **What are VMware vSphere `Storage networks and arrays`?**
                - VMware vSphere uses **`Fibre Channel SAN arrays`**, **`iSCSI SAN Arrays`**, and **`NAS Arrays`** to meet data center storage needs. With storage area networks, you can connect and share storage arrays between groups of servers. This arrangement allows aggregation of the storage resources and provides more flexibility in provisioning them to virtual machines:
                    - **Storage Networks:** In a vSphere environment, storage networks facilitate communication between the ESXi hosts and storage arrays. The communication occurs over a dedicated high-speed network using protocols like `**Fibre Channel (FC)**,` `**Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI)**`, or `**Network Attached Storage (NAS)**.`
                    - **Fibre Channel SAN Arrays:** These are high-speed networks dedicated to storage. They use the Fibre Channel protocol to connect servers (ESXi hosts) to shared storage devices. The storage devices in such an array are typically disk drives housed in a disk array controller.
                    - **iSCSI SAN Arrays:** These arrays use the iSCSI protocol, which enables the SCSI command to be sent over LANs, WANs, or the Internet. iSCSI SAN arrays are an alternative to Fibre Channel, often providing a less expensive way of leveraging shared storage by using existing IP networks.
                    - **NAS Arrays:** NAS arrays provide file-level access storage over a network. Unlike FC and iSCSI, which are block-level storage protocols, NAS uses file-based protocols such as NFS (Network File System).
                - In a VMware vSphere environment, SAN and NAS arrays can be shared between groups of servers, allowing for aggregation and flexible provisioning of storage resources to VMs. This connectivity and sharing of storage resources increase data availability, scalability, and efficiency in the data center.
            - **What are `IP networks` in the context of VMware vSphere?**
                - Each compute server can have multiple physical network adapters to provide high bandwidth and reliable networking to the entire VMware vSphere data center.
            - **What is `vCenter Server - Management server`**?
                - vCenter Server is a centralized management platform for the VMware vSphere suite. It plays a crucial role in managing your VMware virtual environment, including the ESXi hosts and virtual machines. Here's a summary of its key aspects:
                    - **Unified Control Point:** vCenter Server gives a single control point for the entire data center, unifying resources from individual servers to be shared among the virtual machines across the whole data center.
                    - **Data Center Services:** It provides essential data center services such as access control, performance monitoring, and configuration, making it easier to manage complex virtual environments.
                    - **Resource Management:** vCenter Server manages the assignment of virtual machines to ESXi hosts and the distribution of resources to the virtual machines within a given server based on policies set by the system administrator. This feature ensures optimal use of resources and improves overall system performance.
                    - **Resiliency:** If vCenter Server becomes unreachable (for instance, due to a network issue), the ESXi hosts can continue to run the virtual machines based on the last set resource assignments. This resilience ensures that critical services can continue to function even in the event of a network disruption. Once connection to vCenter Server is restored, it can resume management of the data center as a whole.
                - In essence, vCenter Server is an essential component of a vSphere environment, providing centralized management, resource optimization, and a range of critical data center services.
            - **What are `Management clients - Desktop clients`?**
                - Management clients, or desktop clients, are user interfaces allowing administrators to manage and interact with the vSphere environment. These include:
                    - **vSphere Client:** This is a Windows program that is used to configure the host and to operate its virtual machines. It can connect directly to an ESXi host or a vCenter Server instance.
                    - **vSphere Web Client:** This is a browser-based application that connects to the vCenter Server to manage installations and handle the virtual machines' lifecycle. It allows administrators to manage vSphere infrastructure from any system with internet access.
                    - **vSphere Command-Line Interface (vSphere CLI):** This is a set of commands run on a local system or scripts to manage and control vSphere environments. It provides a way to automate and streamline tasks and is particularly useful for repetitive tasks or bulk operations.
                - These management clients provide different ways to interact with vSphere, offering flexibility based on administrator preferences and specific task requirements.
            - **What are `vCenter Single Sign-On`?**
                - This is a service that forms part of the vCenter Server management infrastructure. It enhances security across the VMware cloud infrastructure platform by enabling different vSphere software components to communicate with each other securely. This is done through a secure token exchange mechanism, which negates the need for each component to authenticate a user separately with a directory service, like Active Directory.
                - Here are the components that are deployed when you install vCenter Single Sign-On:
                    - **STS (Security Token Service):** This service issues Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens, which represent a user's identity in each of the vCenter SSO identity sources. These certificates enable users logged on through vCenter SSO to authenticate to any vCenter service that SSO supports.
                    - **Administration Server:** This server allows users with vCenter SSO administrator privileges to configure the SSO service and manage users and groups from the vSphere Client. Initially, only the user [administrator@vsphere.local](mailto:administrator@vsphere.local) has these privileges.
                    - **vCenter Lookup Service:** This service contains topology information about the vSphere infrastructure, enabling vSphere components to connect securely. Other vSphere components use this service to find vCenter SSO and other services.
                    - **VMware Directory Service:** This is the directory service associated with the vsphere.local domain. It's a multi-tenant, peer-replicating directory service that provides an LDAP directory. In multisite mode, an update in one instance automatically updates the instances associated with all other vCenter SSO nodes.
                    - **vCenter Server Plug-ins:** These applications add extra features and functionality to vCenter Server. Some vCenter Server features are implemented as plug-ins and can be managed using the vSphere Client Plug-in Manager.
                    - **vCenter Server Database:** This provides persistent storage for maintaining the status of each virtual machine, host, and user managed in the vCenter Server environment. It can be remote or local to the vCenter Server system.
                    - **tcServer:** Many vCenter Server functions are implemented as web services that require the tcServer. Features that require the tcServer include lCIM/Hardware Status tab, Performance charts, WebAccess, Storage Policy-Based services, and vCenter Service status.
                    - **vCenter Server Agent:** This is the software installed on each managed host that collects, communicates, and runs the actions received from vCenter Server.
                    - **Host Agent:** This software is installed on each managed host as part of the ESXi installation. It collects, communicates, and runs the actions received through the vSphere Client.
    - **What are Client interfaces for vSphere?**
        - Client interfaces for vSphere are the primary tools administrators use to manage and interact with the vSphere environment. There are several critical interfaces for vSphere, each serving specific purposes and use cases:
            - **vSphere Client:** Introduced in vSphere 6.5, this HTML5-based client is included with vCenter Server and serves as the primary interface for connecting to and managing vCenter Server instances. This modern, web-based application provides a comprehensive interface for managing all aspects of the vSphere environment.
            - **vSphere Web Client:** This is a Flex-based web application that was used to manage your vSphere infrastructure before the introduction of the HTML5-based vSphere Client. As of vSphere 6.7, VMware has fully transitioned to the vSphere Client (HTML5) and deprecated the vSphere Web Client (Flex).
            - **VMware Host Client:** This is a web-based application used to manage individual ESXi hosts that are not connected to a vCenter Server system. This is useful for managing standalone ESXi hosts or for troubleshooting issues when vCenter Server is not available.
            - **vSphere Command-Line Interfaces:** These are command-line tools for configuring virtual machines, ESXi hosts, and vCenter Server. vSphere supports multiple command-line interfaces, including the ESXi Shell, vSphere Command-Line Interface (vCLI), and PowerCLI. These powerful and flexible tools allow for the automation and scripting of administrative tasks.
        - Each interface is designed to suit different administrative tasks and scenarios. Some administrators may prefer the graphical user interface (GUI) provided by the vSphere Client or VMware Host Client, while others may prefer the command-line interfaces for their scripting capabilities.
    - **What are vSphere Managed Inventory Objects?**
        - vSphere Managed Inventory Objects are components in a VMware vSphere environment that are tracked and organized for management and configuration purposes. These objects include both virtual and physical elements in the infrastructure, and can be organized into groups or hierarchies. Here is a summary of the key inventory objects:
            - **Data Centers:** These are broad organizational units that aggregate all different types of objects used in the virtual infrastructure, including virtual machines, hosts, networks, and datastores. The data center also defines the namespace for networks and datastores.
            - **Clusters: **These are collections of ESXi hosts and their associated virtual machines. The resources of a cluster's hosts are managed collectively, and clusters can enable features like VMware EVC, vSphere DRS, and vSphere HA.
            - **Datastores:** These are virtual representations of physical storage resources. They serve as the storage location for virtual machine files and can come from various types of storage hardware.
            - **Folders:** Folders allow for grouping of objects of the same type, which simplifies management tasks like setting permissions or alarms. They can contain other folders or a group of objects of the same type.
            - **Hosts:** These are the physical computers on which ESXi is installed. All virtual machines run on hosts or clusters.
            - **Networks:** These are sets of virtual network interface cards (vNICs), switches, and port groups that connect virtual machines to each other or to the physical network outside the virtual data center.
            - **Resource Pools:** These compartmentalize the CPU and memory resources of a host or cluster. Virtual machines run in and draw their resources from these pools.
            - **Templates:** These are primary copies of virtual machines that can be used to create and provision new virtual machines. Templates often have a guest operating system and application software installed.
            - **Virtual Machines:** These are virtualized computer environments in which a guest operating system and associated application software can run. Multiple virtual machines can operate on the same host machine concurrently.
            - **vApps:** These are packages for managing applications, which can contain multiple virtual machines. vApps allow for the bundling and distribution of applications and their required operating environment.
- ### **Configuring vCenter Server**
    - **How can I configure license settings for a vCenter Server system?**
        - Before the evaluation period expires or the currently assigned license expires, a license must be assigned to a vCenter Server system. If there's an upgrade, combination, or division of vCenter Server licenses in Customer Connect, the new licenses must be assigned to the vCenter Server systems and the old licenses must be removed.
        - Here are the prerequisites and procedure:
        - **Prerequisites:** To view and manage licenses in the vSphere environment, you must have the Global.Licenses privilege on the vCenter Server system, where the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web Client runs.
        - **Procedure:**
            - Navigate to the vCenter Server system.
            - Select the Configure tab.
            - Under Settings, select Licensing.
            - Click Assign License.
    - **What are the steps to assign a license in the Assign License dialog box, both for an existing license and a newly created license, in the vSphere Client and the vSphere Web Client?**
        - In the Assign License dialog box, you have the option to either select an existing license or a newly created license. Here are the steps for each task in both the vSphere Client and the vSphere Web Client:
        - **vSphere Client:**
            - Select an existing license: Simply select an existing license from the list and click OK.

            - e. In the Assign License dialog box, select the newly created license, and click OK.
        - **Result:** The license is assigned to the vCenter Server system, and one instance from the license capacity is allocated for the vCenter Server system.
    - **How can I configure statistics settings and collection intervals in the vSphere Client?**
        - To set up how statistical data is recorded, you configure collection intervals for statistics. This data can be accessed through command-line monitoring utilities or by viewing performance charts in the vSphere Client.
        - Here are the prerequisites and the procedure to configure statistics collection intervals:
        - **Prerequisites:** You must have the Performance.ModifyIntervals privilege.
        - **Procedure:**
            - In the vSphere Client, navigate to the vCenter Server instance.
            - Select the Configure tab.
            - Under Settings, select General.
            - Click Edit.
            - To enable or disable a statistics interval, check the box for that interval.
            - To change a statistics interval attribute value, select a value from the drop-down menu:
            - a. In Interval Duration, select the time interval in which statistics data is collected.
            - b. In Save For, select for how long the archived statistics are kept in the database.
            - c. In Statistics Level, select a new level for collecting statistics. The lower the level is, the fewer number of statistic counters are used. Level 4 uses all statistics counters and should only be used for debugging purposes. The statistics level must be less than or equal to the statistics level that is set for the preceding statistics interval. This requirement is a vCenter Server dependency.
            - (Optional) In Database Size, estimate the effect of the statistics settings on the database:
            - a. Enter the number of Physical Hosts.
            - b. Enter the number of Virtual Machines. The estimated space required and the number of database rows required are calculated and displayed.
            - c. If necessary, make changes to your statistics collection settings.
            - Click Save.
        - Example: Relationships Between the Default Settings for Statistics Intervals
            - Samples that are collected every 5 minutes are stored for 1 day.
            - Samples that are collected every 30 minutes are stored for 1 week.
            - Samples that are collected every 2 hours are stored for 1 month.
            - Samples that are collected on 1 day are stored for 1 year.
        - For all statistics intervals, the default level is 1. It uses the Cluster Services, CPU, Disk, Memory, Network, System, and Virtual Machine Operations counters.
    - **What are the data collection levels in vSphere and what metrics do they include?**
        - Each collection interval in vSphere has a default collection level that determines the amount of data gathered and which counters are available for display in the charts. These are also referred to as statistics levels. Here are the details for Levels 1 and 2:
        - Level 1 Metrics:
            - Cluster Services (VMware Distributed Resource Scheduler) – all metrics
            - CPU – cpuentitlement, totalmhz, usage (average), usagemhz
            - Disk – capacity, maxTotalLatency, provisioned, unshared, usage (average), used
            - Memory – consumed, mementitlement, overhead, swapinRate, swapoutRate, swapused, totalmb, usage (average), vmmemctl (balloon)
            - Network – usage (average), IPv6
            - System – heartbeat, uptime
            - Virtual Machine Operations – numChangeDS, numChangeHost, numChangeHostDS
        - This level is best used for long-term performance monitoring when device statistics are not required. Level 1 is the default Collection Level for all Collection Intervals.
        - Level 2 Metrics:
            - Includes all Level 1 metrics
            - CPU – idle, reservedCapacity
            - Disk – All metrics, excluding numberRead and numberWrite.
            - Memory – All metrics, excluding memUsed and maximum and minimum rollup values.
            - Virtual Machine Operations – All metrics
        - Level 2 is best used for long-term performance monitoring when device statistics are not required but you want to monitor more than the basic statistics.

- ### **Using Enhanced Linked Mode**
    - **How do I use Enhanced Linked Mode in vCenter Server?**
        - Enhanced Linked Mode in vCenter Server allows multiple vCenter Server systems to be linked together using one or more Platform Services Controllers. This enables a unified view and search capability across all linked vCenter Server systems, replicating roles, permissions, licenses, and other key data.
        - Here are the steps to use Enhanced Linked Mode:
            - Check the vCenter Server version: Ensure you have vCenter Server 6.0 or later, as Enhanced Linked Mode is not supported with vCenter Server 5.5 and earlier.
            - Check your licensing: Enhanced Linked Mode requires the vCenter Server Standard licensing level. It is not supported with vCenter Server Foundation or vCenter Server Essentials.
            - Connect to the Platform Services Controller: To join vCenter Server systems in Enhanced Linked Mode, connect them to the same Platform Services Controller, or to Platform Services Controllers that share the same vCenter Single Sign-On domain.
            - Login: You can log in to all linked vCenter Server systems simultaneously with a single username and password.
            - View and Search Inventory: You can view and search the inventories of all linked vCenter Server systems within the vSphere Web Client.
            - Replication: Roles, permissions, licenses, tags, and policies are replicated across linked vCenter Server systems.
        - Remember, if you are upgrading from vCenter Server 5.5, you must isolate these systems from any Linked Mode groups before upgrading to vCenter Server 6.0 due to the change in architecture.
        - Before performing any changes, it's always a good practice to consult VMware's official documentation or seek assistance from a VMware professional.
- ### **Configuring Communication Among ESXi, vCenter Server, and the vSphere Web Client**
    - Here are the steps to configure communication among ESXi, vCenter Server, and the vSphere Web Client:
        - Ensure communication ports are open: By default, the vSphere Web Client uses ports 80 and 443 to communicate with vCenter Server and ESXi hosts. These ports need to be open in your firewall to allow communication.
        - Configure your firewall: Open your firewall settings and ensure that ports 80 and 443 are open. The process to do this will vary depending on your firewall software.
        - Set up a web proxy (if required): vCenter Server acts as a web service, so if your environment requires the use of a web proxy, vCenter Server can be proxied like any other web service. You would need to configure your web proxy to forward traffic to vCenter Server.
    - Here's an example of how to set up a proxy for vCenter Server:
        - ```plain text
a. Open the configuration interface of your proxy server.

b. Add a new rule to forward traffic to the IP address of your vCenter Server. This rule should forward traffic on ports 80 and 443.

c. Save your changes and test the connection to vCenter Server through the proxy.```
    - Remember to consult the specific documentation of your firewall and proxy server for the exact steps. Always test any changes in a controlled environment before applying them to your production network.
- ### **Configuring Hosts and vCenter Server**
    - Summary of the steps for configuring ESXi hosts, vCenter Server systems, and the vSphere Web Client:
        - Host Configuration: Before you create virtual machines on your hosts, you must configure the hosts to ensure that they have the correct licensing, network and storage access, and security settings.
        - a. Licensing: Make sure you have a valid license for each ESXi host. This can be done through the vSphere Client by navigating to the host, then the Configure tab, and finally the Licensed Features option.
        - b. Network Access: Each host needs to be correctly configured to communicate with other components in your network. This includes configuring physical NICs, virtual switches, and VMkernel adapters.
        - c. Storage Access: Your host needs access to storage to store virtual machine files. This could be local storage within the host itself or network storage such as an iSCSI or NFS datastore.
        - d. Security Settings: Ensure that your hosts are secure by configuring settings such as the firewall, user accounts and roles, and certificates.
        - Synchronizing Clocks on the vSphere Network: In a vSphere environment, it's crucial to keep the clocks on all hosts and vCenter Server systems synchronized. This helps to ensure that events are logged in the correct order and that tasks and operations are carried out at the correct times. You can configure a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server on each host and on the vCenter Server system to keep clocks synchronized.
        - For more detailed information on these topics, you should refer to the vSphere Security documentation, the vSphere Storage documentation, and the vSphere Networking documentation.

        - For additional information about ESX agents and ESX Agent Manager, you can refer to the guide on Developing and Deploying vSphere Solutions, vServices, and ESX Agents.
    - **How can I set advanced attributes for a host?**
        - Here is the procedure to set advanced attributes for a host, but please take note, changing advanced options is considered unsupported. Typically, the default settings produce the optimum result. Only change these options when you have specific instructions from VMware technical support or a knowledge base article:
            - First, browse to the host in the vSphere Client.
            - Click on the "Configure" tab.
            - Under the "System" section, click on "Advanced System Settings".
            - In "Advanced System Settings", select the item you want to modify.
            - Click the "Edit" button and change the value to the desired setting.
            - Click "OK" to save the changes.
        - Remember to proceed with caution when altering advanced settings to avoid any unintended consequences or system instability.
    - **Why is it important to synchronize clocks on the vSphere network?**
        - Clock synchronization on the vSphere network is crucial because SSL certificates and SAML Tokens, which are time-sensitive, might not be recognized as valid in communications between network machines if the clocks aren't synchronized. This can lead to authentication problems, causing the installation to fail or prevent the vCenter Server Appliance vmware-vpxd service from starting. It can also cause failures in different services, especially when the target ESXi host for the destination vCenter Server Appliance is not synchronized with NTP or when the destination vCenter Server Appliance migrates to an ESXi host set to a different time due to fully automated DRS.
    - **How can I avoid time synchronization issues before installing, migrating, or upgrading a vCenter Server Appliance?**
        - To avoid time synchronization issues, ensure the following:
            - The target ESXi host where the destination vCenter Server Appliance is to be deployed is synchronized to NTP.
            - The ESXi host running the source vCenter Server Appliance is synchronized to NTP.
            - If upgrading or migrating, and if the vCenter Server Appliance is connected to an external Platform Services Controller, ensure the ESXi host running the external Platform Services Controller is synchronized to NTP.
            - If you're upgrading or migrating, verify that the source vCenter Server or vCenter Server Appliance and external Platform Services Controller have the correct time.
    - **How do I synchronize ESXi clocks with an NTP server?**
        - To synchronize ESXi clocks with an NTP server, you can use the VMware Host Client. For information about editing the time configuration of an ESXi host, refer to the vSphere Single Host Management guide. To change time synchronization settings for vCenter Server Appliance, consult "Configuring Time Synchronization Settings in the vCenter Server Appliance" in the vCenter Server Appliance Configuration guide. To edit time configuration for a host, see "Edit Time Configuration for a Host" in the vCenter Server and Host Management guide.
    - **How can I configure the time settings on a host?**
        - Time settings on a host can be configured manually or you can synchronize the time and date of the host by using an NTP server. To do this, follow these steps:
            - In the vSphere Client, navigate to the host in the vSphere inventory.
            - Select Configure.
            - Under System, select Time Configuration and click Edit.
    - **What are the options for setting the time and date of the host?**
        - There are two main options:
            - Manually configure the date and time on this host: This allows you to set the time and date for the host manually.
            - Use Network Time Protocol (Enable NTP client): This option synchronizes the time and date of the host with an NTP server. The NTP service on the host periodically takes the time and date from the NTP server.
    - **If I choose to use the Network Time Protocol, what further options do I have?**
        - When using NTP:
            - In the NTP Servers text box, type the IP addresses or host names of the NTP servers that you want to use.
            - From the NTP Service Startup Policy drop-down menu, select an option for starting and stopping the NTP service on the host:
                - Start and stop with port usage: Starts or stops the NTP service when the NTP client port is enabled or disabled for access in the security profile of the host.
                - Start and stop with host: Starts and stops the NTP service when the host powers on or shuts down.
                - Start and stop manually: Enables manual starting and stopping of the NTP service. You can use the Start, Stop, or Restart buttons to control the status of the NTP service on the host manually at any time. This manual process bypasses the selected startup policy for the NTP service.
            - Click OK to apply the changes.
